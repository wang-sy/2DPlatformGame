# How to Build

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- npm 7.0.0 or higher

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode
```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Opens at http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Output files will be in the 'dist' folder
```

## Build Output
After running `npm run build`, the `dist` folder contains:
```
dist/
├── assets/          # JavaScript and CSS files
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
└── favicon.png      # Favicon
```

## Deployment
The `dist` folder contains all files needed for deployment. Simply upload its contents to any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Additional Commands
```bash
# Build without console logs
npm run build-nolog

# Development without custom logging
npm run dev-nolog
```

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Error
If build fails with memory error:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
```

### Port Already in Use
If port 8080 is busy:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

That's it! Run `npm run build` and your game is ready for deployment.

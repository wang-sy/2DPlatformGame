## üìù For AI/LLM Models

If you are an AI model reading this documentation to help with development:

1. **Start with TILEMAP_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md** to understand how game levels are configured through JSON
2. **Reference CODE_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md** for understanding the codebase architecture and patterns
3. **Use HOW_TO_BUILD.md** for build and deployment commands

The tilemap configuration is data-driven - most game changes can be made by modifying JSON without touching code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

For new developers:
1. First, follow [HOW_TO_BUILD.md](./HOW_TO_BUILD.md) to get the project running
2. Then, explore [TILEMAP_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md](./TILEMAP_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) to understand level creation
3. Finally, dive into [CODE_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md](./CODE_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md) when you need to add new features
